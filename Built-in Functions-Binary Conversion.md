# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)

```



## Output
![438591314-f407e318-7e95-4070-9158-322232cde59a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab93d41d-61e1-47be-ba23-5161c400b82a)


## Result
Thus,the Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is created successfully
